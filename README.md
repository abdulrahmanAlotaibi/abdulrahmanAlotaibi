## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - **DevKamet** 🗻 : A platform to learn the essentials of Computer Science, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Operating Systems using Golang. The product is Almost done 🎉. I'm really happy about the result. The motivation of this platform is a lot of people now only know 'Coding Interviews Preparations' which focuses only on Data Structures and Algorithms. While Data Structures and Algorithms is a critical part of dealing with data at scale or progressing in any field of computer science, most people actually starts memorizing algorithms for the sake of prep interviews. Without any deep understanding to Software, Performance, and how even the CPU works. They are exam takers, not seeking deep knowledge of understanding machines. DevKamet will not be for exam takers or status signaling people, But it will be for engineers who are not afraid of building anything. So I gathered my notebooks from my bachelor's degree and I'm going to publish it in DevKamet in a useful, organized way I hope. And I think DevKamet will close the gaps between useless Academia courses and the industry shallow coding bootcamps where coding interviews is designed to see if you can 'grind' to memorize all the algorithms, which is FAR away from any current industry practice , good engineers don't write algorithms all day, but they understand machines and care deeply about them.

### Behind the scenes of DevKamet 🎥 (Soon)

- **Lightweight Tailwind UI Framework ✨** for Reactjs : I've never liked any CSS Framework. I've always wrote my own vanilla CSS. I tried Material UI, Bootstrap, Semantic UI etc. All of them are really bad. And if you hear someone saying "I used Material UI because why re-invent the wheel" he for sure doesn't understand CSS or frontend in general and the huge cost of working with these frameworks. But After writing A lot of CSS, there is a thing I hate about the development experience which is naming things, in server you might create 10 functions per-day so naming would be easy and you can use prefixes such as UserService.CreateUser & userController.CreateUser . but for the markup I move tremendously fast and I name so many HTML elements and there is a slice of time let's say 3 seconds to name things, and I hate that. And if you work with Data Intensive UIs you may feel that naming is ugly and annoying . Even using BEM naming methodology or kabab case, You can't really compose React components very fast with bad naming. So TailwindCSS gave me re-usability in the CSS level without giving up the identity of the product, interaction design, layout, and general theming. Also, it's very small in size. The design direction for the UI Framework will be only for the most useful components (Inputs, Dropdowns, Modals, Notifications...) without giving up any theming characteristics. for example, I created re-usable components for _modals_ & _poppers_, which expose small APIs to be used by all views.

- 🌱 I'm learning : Probability and Statistics for a next project I'm working on. After reading Skin in the Game, there was a lot of mathematical work I didn't recognize. Nassim has a great eye for randomness and unpredictably.

## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - **DevKamet** 🗻 : A platform to learn the essentials of Computer Science, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Operating Systems using Golang. The product is Almost done 🎉. I'm really happy about the result. The motivation of this platform is a lot of people now only know 'Coding Interviews Preparations' which focuses only on Data Structures and Algorithms. While Data Structures and Algorithms is a critical part of dealing with data at scale or progressing in any field of computer science, most people actually starts memorizing algorithms for the sake of prep interviews. They are exam takers, not seeking deep knowledge of understanding machines.**DevKamet will not be for exam takers or status signaling people, But it will be for engineers who are not afraid of building anything**. So I gathered my notebooks from my bachelor's degree and I'm going to publish it in DevKamet in useful way I hope.

### Behind the scenes of DevKamet 🎥 (Soon)

- **SAAS Way** 🚀 : A place for SAAS Indie devs. From product journeys, Engineering articles, general stories, In a week from now I'll start publishing about how I created my own Content Management System (CMS) and the whole user journey of DevKamet. Also, how my skills transformed dramatically from avoiding all BS Vendors such as authors of architectural books, status signaling people. And I've never been that productive and happy in programming as now!

- **Lightweight Tailwind UI Framework ✨** for Reactjs : I've never liked any CSS Framework. I've always wrote my own vanilla CSS. I tried Material UI, Bootstrap, Semantic UI etc. All of them are really bad. And if you hear someone saying "I used Material UI because why re-invent the wheel" he for sure doesn't understand CSS or frontend in general and the huge cost of working with these frameworks. But After writing A lot of CSS, there is a thing I hate about the development experience which is naming things, in server you might create 10 functions per-day so naming would be easy and you can use prefixes such as UserService.CreateUser & userController.CreateUser . but for the markup I move tremendously fast and I name so many HTML elements and there is a slice of time let's say 3 seconds to name things, and I hate that. And if you work with Data Intensive UIs you may feel that naming is ugly and annoying . Even using BEM naming methodology or kabab case, You can't really compose React components very fast with bad naming. So TailwindCSS gave me re-usability in the CSS level without giving up the identity of the product, interaction design, layout, and general theming. Also, it's very small in size. The design direction for the UI Framework will be only for the most useful components (Inputs, Dropdowns, Modals, Notifications...) without giving up any theming characteristics. for example, I created a re-usable component for _modals_, which expose a small API to be used by all views.

- **Secret Product 👽** (In the product design phase)

- 🌱 I'm learning : Probability and Statists for a next project I'm working on. After reading Skin in the Game, there was a lot of mathematical work I didn't recognize. Nassim has a great eye for randomness and unpredictably.

خير الرجال أصدقهم قولا و عملا، و أنفعهم لغيره. فمن ابتغى بالباطل سببا أوكله الله لسببه، فأقبلت عليه الدنيا بِشرِّ ما فيها، فكل أمرهِ عُسر، و كل مطلبه ذُلْ، فيغدوا زاهدا بما عند الله طامعا بمن دونه و إن صلّى و صام، فمن أكل الباطل أجاعهُ الله الحق.

و ظنّ أن علمه قد زاد بكُتبه، و أن نفوذه قد زادت بمن حوله، غرّتهم الظنون وما أغنتهم من الحق شيئا، فتبددّ عزمهم و سلّط الله عليهم ما يثبط علمهم و عملهم، زادهم الله جهلا و جعل علمهم شاهدا عليهم لا لهم.
‏
فلا يعمل أحدهم عملا إلاّ كان قبيحا ركيكا، فيجرون جري الوحوش بالأنفاس و الأموال، فما أنجزوا إلا بعدما ذاقوا خزي عجزهم و قلة تدبيرهم، فلا يُصبح أحدهم إلا و قد قال:" هذا ما عهدته، قبحُ العمل ضرورة! فاضطريت للقبيح و أنا ذو الحسب و النسب واسع العلم الفطين، و قد زكّتني مدارس الأرض! و اضطريت لقبيح القول و أنا ذو الحسب و النسب واسع العلم الفطين، و قد زكتني مدارس الأرض!" فما فطن من مواطن الحياة إلا القبيح منها. قبّح الله ذكره و عمله.

وما خلق الله الجن و الإنس إلا ليعبدون، فما من عمل جميل إلا أشاع بالأرض كلمة قولها " ماشاء الله!" فكل جميل لله يٌنسب.
فلعلّ شابًا أمسى بحسرة من جهله، فأعانته حسرته على غدِه، فأصبح يعتني بما أمنّ الله عليه من علم و هبة و صحة، فإن أراد الله به خيرًا يفقه بالدين، و ييُسّر عليه العلم، فيتدارك فهم الأمور أسرع من السيل إلى مقرّه.
